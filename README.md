# CSCM77_Lab2 - Multiclass Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Two-layer Neural Networks

In this assignment, we continue the task of image classification on the CIFAR-10 labelled dataset. Will implement two different classification algorithms: SVM and a two-layer neural network. The work programme regarding two pathways are provided below.
